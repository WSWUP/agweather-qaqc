            This function corrects rs by applying a correction factor (a ratio of rso/rs) to each user defined period
            to counteract sensor drift and other errors.

            The start and end of the correction interval is used to cut a section of both rs and rso,
            with these new sections being divided into 60 day periods. Each period is checked for the number of times
            rs exceeds rso. If there are less than three, they are removed (set to rso) as potential voltage spikes or
            other errors, but if there are more then they are left in.
            Each period then has a correction factor calculated based on a user-specified (6 is recommended)
            largest number of points for rs/rso.

            If a period does not contain enough valid data points to fill the user-specified number, the entire period
            is thrown out.

            Averages are formed for both rs and rso of those largest points,
            and then this new average rso is divided by this new average rs to get a final ratio, which is then
            to be multiplied to all points within its corresponding period.

            To prevent the code from correcting data beyond the point of believability, if the correction factor is
            below 0.5 or above 1.5, the data for that period is removed instead.

            In addition, if the correction factor is between 0.97 < X < 1.03, the data is unchanged under the assumption
            that the sensor was behaving as expected.

            Finally, the function returns the corrected solar radiation that has had spikes removed (if applicable)
            and the period-based correction factor applied.

            This main qaqc function takes in two variables and, depending on the code provided, enables different
            correction methods for the user to use to correct data. Once a correction has been applied, user has the
            option to do multiple iterations before finishing. All actions taken are recorded into the log file.

            After each iteration a bokeh graph is generated that shows the changes that have occurred. After the user

        This function is display the 'compiled' ea generated from all available humidity data, and the user will have
        the option to overwrite sections of the 'compiled' ea with ea generated from a variable of their choice, should
        a higher priority humidity variable have worse data than a lower priority one.

        Ex: A station has both vapor pressure (daily average calculated from 15 minute intervals)
        and RH Maximum and Minimum (daily values). The humidity compliation funciton will only use RHMax and RHMin
        to calculate vapor pressure if there is a gap in the provided vapor pressure data. However, for some reason the
        vapor pressure data is bad, either from a faulty sensor or problem with the sampling, while the contemporaneous
        RH data is good. This function will allow you to graphically select the 'bad' section of vapor pressure data
        and overwrite it with the vapor pressure calculated from the present RH Maximum and minimum data.

        Parameters:
            station : string of station name for saving files
            log_path : string of path to log file
            folder_path : string of path to correction files directory
            dt_array : date time array used for bokeh plots
            tmax : 1D array of maximum temperature values
            tmin : 1D array of minimum temperature values
            tavg : 1D array of average temperature values
            compiled_ea : the array of ea values that has been generated from all provided humidity variables
            ea : 1D array of vapor pressure values, which may be empty
            ea_col : column of ea variable in data file, if it is provided
            tdew : 1D array of dewpoint temperature values, which may be empty
            tdew_col : column of Tdew variable in data file, if it is provided
            tdew_ko : 1D array of dewpoint temperature values, where missing values are filled in by Tmin-Ko curve
            rhmax : 1D array of maximum relative humidity values, which may be empty
            rhmax_col : column of rhmax variable in data file, if it was provided
            rhmin : 1D array of minimum relative humidity values, which may be empty
            rhmin_col : column of rhmin variable in data file, if it was provided
